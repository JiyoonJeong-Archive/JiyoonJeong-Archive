Hello, I'm Jiyoon. 

I am interested in **how people effectively process incoming sensory information through attention**.

My research aims to study its neural mechanisms using EEG and artificial neural networks.

I'm currently studying at University of Toronto as a Ph.D. candidate in Psychology. 

I received my B.S. and M.S. in Psychology and a B.E. in Computer Science from Korea University.
