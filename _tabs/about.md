Hello, I'm Jiyoon. 

My academic objective is to study **Visual perception**, **Attention**, and **Object recognition**. 

I am also interested in using **Machine learning** and **Deep learning models** to understand human cognition.

<br/>

Go to [Research](https://jiyoonjeong-archive.github.io/posts/Research) and [Projects](https://jiyoonjeong-archive.github.io/posts/Projects) for more information.

You can download my [CV](https://jiyoonjeong-archive.github.io/posts/CV) here.

[Contact](https://jiyoonjeong-archive.github.io/posts/Contact) me if you have any question. 

<br/>

Thank you for visiting my homepage.
